# hello-world
This is a place where I store ideas, resources, and share and discuss things with others. 
I am an Army Vet, Mom of 3 and love to learn new things. I also love to act and have bee doing that on an off since I was a kid. I've even performed while stationed in Korea and deployed to Iraq!
